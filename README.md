Port of Bloodborne (PS4, **v1.09**, every retail release). The runtime and renderer run natively on ARM64, FEXCore translates the game's x86-64 code, and Mesa Turnip drives the GPU. Experimental.

## How it works

This is a port, not an emulator. No PS4 hardware, firmware or operating system is emulated, and no PS4 BIOS is needed. It works like Wine + DXVK for one game: the game's own `eboot.bin` runs in an Android app process, its calls to PS4 system libraries land in native replacements, and its graphics are translated to Vulkan. Because the PS4 has an x86-64 CPU and the phone an ARM64 one, the game's machine code needs one more layer.

**Translated while the game runs:**

| What | From | To | By |
|---|---|---|---|
| The game's CPU code (`eboot.bin`) | x86-64 (AVX, BMI) | ARM64 | [FEXCore](https://github.com/FEX-Emu/FEX), built into the game process as a library: only the game's code goes through it, no x86 Linux, Wine or Box64 |
| GPU commands the game writes itself (it links libGnm statically) | AMD GCN command buffers (PM4) | Vulkan commands | the renderer |
| Shaders | AMD GCN | SPIR-V | the renderer's shader recompiler |

**Native ARM64 code, no translation:**

- **Runtime**: replaces the PS4 system libraries the game imports: threads, mutexes, semaphores, memory, time, files, save data, controller input, audio with ATRAC9 decoding, video output, movie playback. A call from the game goes straight to this code.
- **Renderer**: based on [shadPS4](https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4)'s, through the [bloodborne_pc](https://github.com/deadinside28/bloodborne_pc) Linux port: command processing, texture and buffer caches, FSR 3.1, Lossless Scaling frame generation.
- **Vulkan driver**: Mesa Turnip, shipped in the APK.
- **The Android app**: menu, on-screen controller, Steam sign-in.

FEXCore runs in its fastest mode (no x86 memory-ordering emulation, reduced x87 precision). The PC build has no translation layer at all: there, the game's x86-64 code runs directly on the CPU.

## Features

- **Faster rendering** — new in 0.8.0: about 30 → 34–35 FPS on the AYN Thor in Central Yharnam, with steadier frame times
- **Updates from the app** — new in 0.8.0: menu → **Check for updates** downloads and installs the newest release
- **Mods**: install .zip, .7z or PS4 .pkg mods for 1.09, switch them on and off and set their load order
- **Cheats**: infinite health and infinite blood vials/items, switched on and off while you play
- **Game settings** in the app's menu: skip the online/offline screen (straight to the main menu), skip intros, free camera, debug menu
- **Lossless Scaling frame generation** (2×, 3×, 4×). Sign in with Steam in the app and it downloads `Lossless.dll` from your own copy of Lossless Scaling
- **FSR 3.1** upscaling and **FSR 3.1 frame generation**. FSR 3.1 frame generation has poor image quality for now; try Lossless Scaling frame generation instead
- **On-screen PlayStation controller** with an editable layout; physical controllers work too
- **Two Vulkan drivers in one APK**, picked automatically for your GPU; newer Turnip builds download from the **GPU driver** menu
- 16:9 picture on any screen, including foldables

## Devices

| Tested | SoC | GPU | Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| AYN Thor | Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 | Adreno 740 | Mesa main |
| Oppo Find N5 | Snapdragon 8 Elite | Adreno 830 | Mesa turnip/gen8 |

Other Adreno 6xx/7xx/8xx devices are untested. Requires Android 9+ and 4 KB memory pages; tested with 16 GB RAM.

## Install

1. Download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/ducvd89/Bloodborne-Android/releases/latest) and install it.
2. Copy your own extracted dump of Bloodborne with the **1.09 update** merged into it to the phone (any release below).
3. Open the app, select the folder containing `eboot.bin` (or the folder that holds it), and allow storage access. The first launch takes a few minutes.

Every retail release runs the same 1.09 executable, so all of them work:

| Region | Bloodborne | Game of the Year / The Old Hunters |
|---|---|---|
| US | CUSA00900 | CUSA03179 |
| EU | CUSA00207 | CUSA03173 |
| UK | CUSA00208 | |
| Japan | CUSA00299 | CUSA03014 |
| Asia | CUSA01363 | CUSA03023 |

Use the original 1.09 `eboot.bin`. Some dumps ship one with a 60 fps patch already applied; that one crashes in the gestures menu.

The APK contains no game files. Updates keep saves, and settings too, except once: updating from 0.7.x or older to 0.8.0 sets the new [default settings](#default-settings-and-performance). Later releases install from the menu (**Check for updates**); Android asks once to allow the app to install apps.

On ColorOS / OxygenOS (Oppo, OnePlus) a "Security warning" about a malicious app may appear at launch. Tap **Got it**; the game keeps running. ColorOS shows it for any app that runs Linux programs, such as Termux and Winlator.

## The menu

Swipe in from the left edge (or press Back) to open the menu. Its sections:

- **Game:** resume, Game settings, Cheats, Mods, restart.
- **Graphics:** graphics settings (upscaler, render size, FPS limit, model detail, effects), Lossless Scaling and the GPU driver.
- **Controls:** turn the on-screen controller on or off; edit its layout (move, resize or reset the buttons). With the controller on, drag anywhere outside the buttons to turn the camera.
- **Storage:** choose the game folder, quit.
- **App:** check for updates (installing one closes the game, so save first).

Each entry shows its current setting underneath.

## Default settings and performance

The defaults are tuned on the AYN Thor: a 752×424 scene upscaled by FSR 3.1 to 1280×720, the costly effects (SSAO, SSR, dynamic shadows, depth of field, motion blur, the game's anti-aliasing) off, **lowest model detail** and a 60 FPS limit. Lossless Scaling and cheats start off. They apply on a first install and once when updating from 0.7.x or older; your controller mapping, GPU driver and mods choice are kept.

On the Thor most of the GPU's time goes to geometry, not pixels: a smaller render size barely changes the frame rate, the model detail setting does (lowest: about +10%). Lossless Scaling 2× costs little GPU time and doubles the frames shown.

## Game settings and cheats

**Game settings** are patches to the game, applied when it starts (Apply restarts it): skip the online/offline screen (on by default; there is no PSN here), skip the startup intros, the free camera (Cross + L3) and the game's debug menu (needs its font files).

**Cheats** switch at once, while you play:

- **Infinite health:** your HP refills to full every frame.
- **Infinite blood vials and items:** using a blood vial, bullet or other item leaves its count as it was. Items you move to storage or give away stay in your inventory too.

They are code hooks in the 1.09 executable (the same places as Shiningami's GoldHEN cheats), so they work on every release. They are always in place and switched by flags the game process reads from the app.

## Lossless Scaling frame generation

[Lossless Scaling](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/) generates extra frames between the game's own, so the picture moves more smoothly. The app runs it through [lsfg-vk](https://github.com/PancakeTAS/lsfg-vk) 1.0, adapted for the Turnip driver. Lossless Scaling itself is not included: it needs your own copy, bought on Steam.

1. Open the menu → **Get Lossless.dll from Steam**.
2. Scan the QR code with the Steam app on your phone (Steam Guard → scan QR code), or choose **Sign in with password instead** and enter your Steam Guard code.
3. The app checks that your account owns Lossless Scaling and downloads only `Lossless.dll` (about 7 MB).
4. Open **Lossless Scaling** in the menu and pick 2×, 3× or 4×. Lower flow scale and performance mode are faster. Changes apply while you play.

The sign-in is used once, for that download. The app keeps no password and no sign-in token; the file is saved in the app's own storage. You can also copy `Lossless.dll` from a PC (`steamapps/common/Lossless Scaling/Lossless.dll`) next to your game folder, e.g. `/sdcard/Bloodborne/Lossless.dll` beside `/sdcard/Bloodborne/CUSA03173`.

Tips:

- Frames are smoothest when the screen refresh rate is the FPS limit × the multiplier. The app sets the screen to that rate when it can: 30 FPS × 2 → 60 Hz, 30 × 4, 40 × 3 or 60 × 2 → 120 Hz.
- It works with any upscaler and replaces FSR 3.1 frame generation. It sees only finished frames, without the game's motion vectors, so fast motion and the HUD can show artifacts.
